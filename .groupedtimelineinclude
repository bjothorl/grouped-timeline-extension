# Files to track with Grouped Timeline
# Add patterns for files you want included in the Grouped Timeline

# This will track all files, and usually works well, but can be slow in large projects. As such, it is commented out by default:
**/* 

# By default, no files are tracked unless specified here
# After changing this file, refresh the Grouped Timeline view to see the updates
