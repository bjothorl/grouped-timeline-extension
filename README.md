# Grouped Timeline for VS Code

A VS Code extension that groups near-simultaneous changes in your local timeline, allowing you to restore grouped or individual files to any previous save point - much like JetBrains's Rider's Local History feature.

# Features
- Groups timeline entries by time window
- Restores individual files or groups of files
- Configurable file tracking through .groupedhistoryinclude
- Preview changes before restoring
- Sort by time or number of files changed
