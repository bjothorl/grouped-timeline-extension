# Grouped Timeline: Local History Restore Manager for VS Code!

A VS Code extension that groups near-simultaneous changes in your local timeline, allowing you to restore grouped or individual files to any previous save point - much like JetBrains Rider's Local History feature.

### No previous install necessary, works retroactively!
Can't figure out exactly which files changed (and how) yesterday? No problem! This extension will tell you!

# Features
- Groups timeline entries by time window
- Restores individual files or groups of files
- Configurable file tracking through .groupedtimelineinclude
- Preview changes before restoring
- Sort by time or number of files changed

# Source Code
This extension is open source and the code is available [here](https://github.com/bjothorl/grouped-timeline-extension).
