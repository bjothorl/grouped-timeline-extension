# Files to track in grouped history
# Add patterns for files you want included in grouped history

# This will track all files, and usually works well, but can be slow in large projects. As such, it is commented out by default:
# **/* 

# By default, no files are tracked unless specified here
# After changing this file, refresh the Grouped History view to see the updates
